Each artist, song and album has a play button that allows you to listen to music while browsing the page. By clicking the artist’s play button you can listen to their ten most popular songs, by clicking the song’s play button you can listen to the whole song. Similarly, you can listen to the whole album by clicking on its play button. It uses the Spotify Web Player and streams are counted as if you were listening on Spotify.
